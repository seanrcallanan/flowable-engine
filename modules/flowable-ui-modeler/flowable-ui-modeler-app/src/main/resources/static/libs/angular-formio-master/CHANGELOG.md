### 3.0.0
This is a reverse-compatible release that has the following changes over 2.x branch.

#### Changes
 - This release introduces the Form Manager system, see Wiki for documentation.
 - Now defaults to Bootstrap 4 instead of Bootstrap 3 and provides Font Awesome by default.
 - Changed the (click) event for formio-grid to (rowSelect).
 - Another major change to the 3.x branch is the FormioGrid component. This can now handle both Forms and Submissions.
 
 #### For Submissions
 ```<formio-grid [src]="'https://examples.form.io/example''"></formio-grid>```
 
 #### For Forms
 ```<formio-grid [src]="'https://examples.form.io'" [gridType]="'form'"></formio-grid>'```
 
 - Custom Grid Headers, Body, and Footers: The latest 3.x also allows you to pass along custom Headers, Body, and Footers to the GridComponent, like so.
 
 ```js
 @Component({
   template: `....`
 })
 export class CustomHeader extends SubmissionGridHeaderComponent {}
 ```
 
 ```html
 <formio-grid [src]="'https://examples.form.io/example'" [components]="{
   header: CustomHeader,
   body: SubmissionGridBodyComponent,
   footer: SubmissionGridFooterComponent
 }"></formio-grid>
 ```
 
 This enables you to fully customize the Grid output.
